/*
        Task description
        Write a function:

        class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }

        that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

        { i : A â‰¤ i â‰¤ B, i mod K = 0 }

        For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

        Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
        K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
        A â‰¤ B.
